# proxy-pool
Proxy pool class implemented with a thread pool under the hood. Some proxy scrapers included.

This implementation doesn't use any database backend, instead it uses a sorted list of proxies with the fastest proxies at the beginning of the list.

Some scrapers included, you're gonna need beautifulsoup4 for some of them.
